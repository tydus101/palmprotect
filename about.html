            Palm Protect was made in participation of the 4th annual BrickHack at R.I.T, developed over the course of 24 hours.
            Type up a food item in the search bar to see if it uses palm oil or not! Palm Protect will tell if the food item contains palm oil or not. This application seeks to raise peopleâ€™s awareness of the problem with the palm oil industry.
            Palm oil is a popular ingredient in food and product alike. However, the practices of many palm plantations from which these oils are produced are usually unethical and unsustainable in practice. Deforestation, loss of natural habitats, and increase of greenhouse gas emissions are some of the problems attributed to the palm oil industry.
